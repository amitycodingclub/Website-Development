A prototype website of Amity University Madhya Pradesh was designed and developed by me.

This website includes Student Registration page and login page as well where student can view his/her profile,view
courses pursing and other student related informations.

The technology used here includes:

Front-end

1. HTML

2. CSS

Back-end

1. Python Common Gateway Interface(CGI)

2. Javascript


This website also includes a MySQL database connected to it for storing data filled in registration forms,usernames,passwords etc..


Plz find attached a complete package of website screenshot, database file and source code of the website.


To ensure proper working of this website run it on CGI server since its Back-end is developed using CGI and open Main page attched inside web folder.
